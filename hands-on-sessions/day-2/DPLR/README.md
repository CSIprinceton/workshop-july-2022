# Deep Modeling with Long-Range Electrostatic Interactions (DPLR)
Hands-on sessions - Day 2 - July 8, 2022

Details of the DPLR method can be found in this paper [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 124107 (2022)]. 

## Aims
The DP models lack explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe properties that derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this limitation, DPLR extend the DP model by including the long-range electrostatic interactions, which improved the accuracy and predictive power of DP. 
This tutorial will show how to train a DPLR model and how to run DPLR simulations.

## Objectives
The objectives of this tutorial session are:

1. Train a DPLR model

3. Run a DPLR molecular dynamics simulation 

We will use liquid water as an example. The data used in this example is downloaded form DP Library https://dplibrary.deepmd.net/#/project_details?project_id=202202.001
