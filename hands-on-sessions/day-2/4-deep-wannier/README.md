# Deep Modeling with Deep Dipole
Hands-on sessions - Day 2 - July 8, 2022

## Overview
The Deep Potential model only characterizes the potential energy surface of an atomic system, leaving electronic degrees of freedom unmodelled. The Deep Dipole model fills this gap by predicting atomistic electric dipoles and global polarization.  
In this session we will introduce its background, training and application.

## Objectives
0. Introduction to wannierization and the Deep Dipole model.
1. Perform maximal localization of wannier centers with the Wannier90 code, based on orbitals from self-consistent DFT calcultions. 
2. Train a deep dipole model
3. Analyze a MD trajectory with the Deep Dipole model.
