# Deep Modeling for Molecular Simulation
===
### Hands on sessions - Day 1
### Installation of DeePMD-kit and accessing the DP library

## Aims

DeePMD-kit is a package written in Python/C++ that implements deep learning algoritms for molecular simulation.
In particular, it is able to learn the potential energy surface, dipole moments, and polarizability from appropriate training sets.
The aim of this tutorial is to describe the available installation methods and explore the DP library, a repository of models built using DeePMD-kit.
